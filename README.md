# Days-Of-365_Kaggle_mastery-github_contributions-linkdin_networking_
  -> Days Of 365_Kaggle_mastery:
  complete AI and data science live practics sets and strategy 

 Day1: planing and sigh up for website
 like linkdin , github ,etc
 Day2:  create kaggle.com accounts 
 Day3: linkdin and kaggke plannings
 day 4 kagel:
day 4 : installation 
python -> data :
1. analysis 
2. data science 
3.  AI 
data science / AI -> ML , DL 
python  - requirements system :
1.  64 bit 
2. VScode: ( IDE : 1- Python .py  , .npby-for jupyter  , 2 - markdown .md  ,   ) 
3. gitbash 
4. git  for repo  track 
5. miniconda  for basic data analysis  , ML  Tasks ( install miniconda , python , vscode , )

miniconda Starting cond: 1 . Creating environments
2. Creating environments: conda create --name <env-name>
and to add pakage : conda create --name myenvironment python numpy pandas 
-> Listing environments
To see a list of all your environments: (conda info --envs)
Installing packages
You can also install packages into a previously created environment. To do this, you can either activate the environment you want to modify or specify the environment name on the command line:

# via environment activation
conda activate myenvironment
conda install matplotlib

# via command line option
conda install --name myenvironment matplotlib

Updating conda
To see your conda version, use the following command:

conda --version
No matter which environment you run this command in, conda displays its current version:

conda 25.11.2.dev49

first : conda activate
second : conda update conda
 and  check the conda env list 
 

 Day 5 : vscode , git bash , miniconda integratioon : -> 
 
 step 1. start git bash 
 2. nevigate to your miniconda  directory  in c:/user 
 3. writing following steps :
  a . echo  ".${PWD }/conda.sh">>~/.bashrc
4. or copy and paste the path to files in ~/bashrc 

open git bash and run the ( git init bash 

->> Day 6: Installation tips -

 enrol - control - admin rights 
 window - installation ( write username - no space , no captil latter , no numeric , no char)
 
ex: ramesh , admin 

windows operating system  you can create multiple accounts- 
 note: tps- go to windows satting and  go accounts - create new user and then admin 
 1. create new user details: user name (tech , pass - Rknc8791@!, 1 qns what was your first pet's name?- ramesh , 2 qns  what was your childhood nickname?- mahakal ,3 qns what's the name of first school you attended? - ramesh kumar )
2. create the github , github student developer pack  accont , 
3. connect the vs code
 
Day 7:
first line of code in python ,  write any program like  print ("hello word" )

Day 8: learn complete python 

Day 9: Jupyter Notebooks are important for python and AI
-> 1. python file extension .py (like 1.py) and use #for comments outs use shortcut cltr+/ 
commemt outs means to write the code  and explain  the code and  not run the line of code .
-> to explain each code line of code or provide options 
-> to enable or disable the code \ code chunk 
ctrl+/ 

2. -> jupyter notebook 
use 	ipynb - i python notebook 

use jupyter notebooks:
1. jupyter Lab 
2. google colab 
3. kaggle.com 
4. vs code 
-> Vs code:  install jupyter lab , ipykernel 
--------------------------------------------------
What is PyPI?

PyPI (Python Package Index) is the official repository of Python packages.
It is a central place where developers publish and share Python libraries.
What does PyPI do?

PyPI allows you to:

✔ Discover Python packages
✔ Install libraries using pip
✔ Manage package versions
✔ Access documentation and source code
ex:pip install requests

PyPI vs pip

PyPI → Package repository (storage)

pip → Package manager (installer)

-> install jupyter lab:
when you can open the python terminal then use !pip install jupyter lab  ! only use jupyter lab 
and you can use the cmd then run the pip install jupyter lab 

-> google colab :
goto google chrom and search the google colab and open the jupyter notebook 

-> kaggle.com 
 : logoin kaggle.com 
 and open the notebook  its very simple for previously methods 

note :
 when  you can use jupyter lab in vs code then you face the any problem for selecting kernel then install the (ipykernel pakage ) then solve the selecting kernel problem
